Intro
-----

A music server + web-ui bundle, built for a specific purpose:

After trying out a dozen MPD and Mopidy frontends I was disappointed that none had the usability of foobar2000 (including album shuffle).

This is specifically for setting up a hifi station on an RPI and allowing it to play endlessly through a selection of albums.

### Core Features

 - Playlist Grouped by Artist + Album
 - Playmodes: Album Shuffle, Song Shuffle, Song Repeat, Default
 - Quickly Scan and Update Files through the UI
 - tabbed playlists

### Current Limitations

 - no volume control
 - no seeker
 - no streaming external data or streaming through the UI
 - no duplicate songs in one playlist

## Future Features

- custom sorting/grouping
- custom metadata attributes ?
- direct metadata writing ?
